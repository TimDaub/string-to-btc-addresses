node-encode-text-in-blockchain
==============================

This little script encodes a given text into valid bitcoin addresses that can later
be used as outputs in a transaction in order to save a message _forever_ in the blockchain.

:heart: this is so romantic

In order to use the script do this:

1. npm install
2. open `config.json` and eventually adjust `encode`
3. node index
